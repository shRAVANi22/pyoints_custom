    Parameters
    ----------

    Parameters
    ----------
    A,B : array_like(Number, shape=(n, k))
        Arrays representing `n` corresponding points with `k` dimensions.

    -------

    Notes
    -----
    Implements the registration algorithm of Besl and McKay (1992) [1]. The
    idea has been taken from Nghia Ho (2013) [2]. Code of [2] has been
    generalized to `k` dimensional space.
